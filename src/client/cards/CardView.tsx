/**
 * Renders a card's state with the component its card template names. The
 * template name binds schema and component together, so neither half can be
 * paired with the other's data.
 *
 * The read path parses a partial configuration, which does not run the card
 * state check `parseDashboardConfiguration` does, so state is validated here.
 * One card that does not fit its template says so where it sits rather than
 * taking the dashboard down with it.
 *
 * A template the dashboard does not have is reported the same way. That is the
 * whole of `includedCardTemplates` today (D32), so every card says so until the
 * shadcn templates land.
