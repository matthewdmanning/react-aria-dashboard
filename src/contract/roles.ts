 * The roles file (D19, D35). Roles are configured by editing this file, which

 * that reaches a role, so `roles: edit` and `roles: write` gate nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately not part of dashboard configuration: `service` rewrites that
 * whole object on every applied batch, so a role living there would be data in
 * a service-written file rather than a source import, and the trust level above
 * would not be real.
 *
 * `admin` and `user` ship as defaults, not as fixed names — add, change, or
 * remove entries here.
