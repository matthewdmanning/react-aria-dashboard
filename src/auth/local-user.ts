/**
 * How a caller proves it is the local user (D35) — the OS account running the
 * server, which holds every permission because it can edit the roles file, the
 * dashboard data, and the source anyway.
 *
 * Binding to `127.0.0.1` proves the caller is on the same *machine*, not that
 * it is the same *user*: on a multi-user host any other OS account can reach
 * loopback. The proof is a random token written to a file only the owning user
 * can read (mode 0600). Reading that file is the check — the filesystem does
 * the work, not this module.
 *
 * Two kinds of caller, one token:
 *
 * - `mcp` runs over stdio as a child process, so it is already the local user
 *   by construction, and reads the token file directly.
 * - a browser cannot read files, so the server prints the URL carrying the
 *   token on startup. Only whoever can see the server's own stdout gets it —
 *   the same user again. This is how Jupyter authenticates a local notebook.
 *
 * Each platform restricts the file its own way — see `restrictToOwner`.
 */

/**
 * Leaves the token readable by its owner and nobody else.
 *
 * POSIX: `chmod` to 0600.
 *
 * Windows: `chmod` there only maps onto the read-only flag, so it grants
 * nothing — a token written with mode 0600 still lands world-readable. `icacls`
 * sets a real ACL instead: `/inheritance:r` drops the entries inherited from
 * the parent directory, and `/grant:r` then names this account as the only one
 * with access.
 *
 * A failure here is reported and not thrown. The dashboard still runs and the
 * token still authenticates; what is lost is the file's protection, which
 * matters only where another account shares the machine.
