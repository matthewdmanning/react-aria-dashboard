# Agent Router

What you need, and where it lives. This file routes; it does not restate. Where a fact has a real source — `package.json`, the git log, the filesystem — go there rather than trusting a copy.

## How to respond

- End a long response with a summary in bullet points. Plain language, no implementation detail, 1-2 lines per item.
- Size each bullet by severity and how load-bearing it is. A minor item gets a clause; something severe, or something later work will rest on, gets the length needed to act on it without reading back up.
- Concise, but sufficient to decide from. Uniform-length bullets flatten the signal — a formatting nit should not read the same weight as a security decision.

## Non-negotiables

- Never commit credentials, tokens, personal content, real dashboard data, or sensitive field names or values. Fixtures are placeholder-only.
- Keep the dashboard general-purpose. Job-search and study data are examples, never domain concepts.
- Do not derive current requirements from material marked legacy, quarantined, superseded, archived, or backup.

## When documents disagree

Each fact has exactly one home. Two documents stating the same fact is a bug — fix it by deleting one, not by deciding which wins.
